This is a collection of the different Machine Learning and Deep Learning Projects undertaken by me.  Some of these projects are part of the PGP AI-ML course from Great Lakes Institute of Management, to which I am currently enrolled to.

I have collected all the different projects, assessments & other research ideas that I have either been assigned to during my PGP Course or 
have come across while exploring different nuances of my academic journey.

Some of these projects have been performed on curated datasets, while some have been extracted from the internet. Some projects have been an extension
of existing projects & I have tried to improve the performance of the same, while have been on fresh datasets where I have tried to achieve good results.

All projects have associated explanations & the idea behind executing the same.

Do reach out to me in case of any queries or suggestions on further improving my work. Cheerio :-)

### Cluster Analysis on city-vehicles for better prediction of mpg figures for each class of vehicle
---
The dataset was used in the 1983 American Statistical Association Exposition. The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, to be predicted in terms of 2 multivalued discrete and 4 continuous variables.

### Skills and Tools
LinearRegression, Grid Search CV, PCA, AgglomerativeClustering, KMeansClustering

### Classifying Cars based on their Silhouttes 
---
The purpose of the case study is to classify a given silhouette as one of three different types of vehicle, using a set of features extracted from the silhouette. The vehicle may be viewed from one of many different angles.
Four "Corgie" model vehicles were used for the experiment: a double-decker bus, Chevrolet van, Saab 9000 and an Opel Manta 400 cars.This particular combination of vehicles was chosen with the expectation that the bus, van and either one of the cars would be readily distinguishable, but it would be more difficult to distinguish between the cars.

#### Skills and Tools
PCA, K-Fold Cross Validation, Grid Search CV, SVM
